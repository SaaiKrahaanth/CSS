### Display and Positioning Review Summary:

In this lesson, you've learned various ways to control element positioning and layout on a webpage using CSS. Here's a breakdown:

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Position Property:**
   - `relative`: Position an element relative to its default position.
   - `absolute`: Position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
   - `fixed`: Fix the element in place regardless of scrolling.
   - `sticky`: Makes the element stick to a defined offset when scrolling.

2. **Z-Index:**
   - Controls the stacking order of overlapping elements. Higher values appear in front.

3. **Display Property:**
   - `inline`: Elements flow inline, cannot have width/height.
   - `block`: Elements take up the full width of their container.
   - `inline-block`: Behaves like inline, but allows width and height control.

4. **Float and Clear Properties:**
   - `float`: Move elements to the left or right.
   - `clear`: Prevent elements from floating beside each other.

5. **Box Model and Positioning:**
   - The box model plays a crucial role in positioning elements. By adjusting the padding, borders, and margins, you can control spacing around elements and create a more organized layout.

#### Next Steps:
Experiment with your **style.css** file, applying the concepts youâ€™ve learned about positioning, display, and layout. After that, move on to adding and manipulating images in the next unit!

### Cheatsheet for Quick Reference:
- **Positioning Values**: `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`
- **Display Types**: `inline`, `block`, `inline-block`
- **Float/ Clear**: `float: left`, `float: right`, `clear: left`, `clear: right`
- **z-index**: Use to layer elements (higher values appear in front).
