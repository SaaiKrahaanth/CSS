### **Typography - Favorite Fonts** ✍  

This project explores three major font categories—**Serif, Sans-Serif, and Monospaced**—with a focus on digital readability and historical significance.  

1️⃣ **Serif** – Fonts with decorative strokes at the ends of letters, often used for traditional and readable body text.  
   - **Example:** *Garamond* (16th Century)  

2️⃣ **Sans-Serif** – Clean, modern fonts without extra strokes, commonly used on digital screens.  
   - **Example:** *Helvetica* (1957)  

3️⃣ **Monospaced** – Fonts where each character takes up the same width, useful for coding and typewriters.  
   - **Example:** *Space Mono* (2016)  

💡 **Key Takeaway:** Typography plays a vital role in digital design, impacting readability, aesthetics, and user experience! 🚀
